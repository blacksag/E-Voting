# E-Voting
A C++ project using file handling which is used in my school to select the cabinet ministers.

# About
* The project is made in the year 2015 using the basic of C++. 
* A single cpp file (VOTING2015.CPP) is created containg all the code using Turbo C++. Thus the file contain the code which can be compiled on the old DOS compilers which uses "conio.h".
* The coding style is bad as there is no OOPs concept, strings are hard codded and flow control is done by jump statement "goto" making it hard to understand. Still it was a project that is used and had made a impact by saving lots of papers and human efforts.

# THE ROAD AHED
Electronic voting applicatioon is a basic thing in this market of fast growing technology and hence this basic project can be used to create one.
